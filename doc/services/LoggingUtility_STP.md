# LoggingUtility Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the LoggingUtility service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [LoggingUtility_SRS.md](LoggingUtility_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations and structured logging capabilities.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- File system with permission control capabilities
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- Environment variable manipulation capabilities

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, file handle exhaustion, concurrent overload
- **External Dependency Failures**: File system errors, permission issues
- **Configuration Corruption**: Invalid environment variables, missing configuration
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements with negative cases
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions and deadlock scenarios under stress

## 3. Destructive API Test Cases

### 3.1 API Contract Violations

**Test Case DT-API-001**: Log and LogError with invalid or unusual inputs
- **Objective**: Test API contract violations for structured logging
- **Destructive Inputs**: 
  - nil context, nil StructuredLogContext
  - Empty/nil message strings
  - Log messages with invalid unicode characters
  - Log messages with binary data and control characters
  - Only Log: Invalid LogLevel values (-1, 999, MaxInt)
  - nil/empty component names
  - Component names with invalid unicode characters
  - Component names with binary data and control characters
  - Context containing channels, functions, unsafe pointers
  - Struct with fields containing JSON special characters
  - Struct with extremely long field names
  - Log invalid datetime values
- **Expected**:
  - Service handles nil gracefully without crashes
  - Unicode and binary data are properly encoded
  - Circular references are detected and prevented (REQ-FORMAT-003)
  - Unsupported LogLevels are handled without panics
  - Unsupported types are handled without panics
  - Large messages are processed or truncated safely
  - JSON encoding handles special characters properly
  - Invalid unicode is handled without corruption
  - Invalid datetime is handled without corruption
  - Only LogError: Stack trace capture

**Test Case DT-API-002**: Log and LogError with excessive data
- **Objective**: Test API for excessive data
- **Destructive Inputs**:
  - Log struct with 100+ fields
  - Log map with 10,000+ key-value pairs
  - Log slice with mixed types and nil elements
  - Log interface{} containing other interfaces
  - Log struct with embedded structs (>10 levels deep)
  - Extremely large data structures (>10MB)
  - Only Log: Circular reference structures
  - Only LogError: Recursive error creation (error about logging error)
  - Only LogError: Errors containing circular references
- **Expected**:
  - Complex types are serialized correctly
  - Depth limiting prevents infinite recursion (REQ-FORMAT-003)
  - Type information is preserved where possible
  - Performance remains acceptable
  - Large messages are processed or truncated safely
  - Circular references are detected and prevented (REQ-FORMAT-003)

**Test Case DT-API-004**: IsLevelEnabled State Violations
- **Objective**: Test level checking under invalid conditions
- **Destructive Inputs**:
  - Concurrent level changes during checks
  - Invalid LogLevel values (-1, 999, MaxInt)
- **Expected**:
  - Safe state access, consistent results
  - Unsupported LogLevels are handled without panics

### 3.2 Resource Exhaustion and Performance Testing

**Test Case DT-RESOURCE-001**: Memory Exhaustion
- **Objective**: Test behavior under memory pressure
- **Method**: 
  - Log arrays with 100,000+ elements
  - Log extremely large structured objects until memory exhausted
  - Monitor memory usage and garbage collection
  - Verify graceful degradation
- **Expected**:
  - GC pressure doesn't cause excessive delays
  - No memory leaks detected

**Test Case DT-RESOURCE-002**: File Handle Exhaustion
- **Objective**: Test file logging under resource constraints
- **Method**:
  - Open multiple LoggingUtility instances with file output
  - Exhaust available file handles
  - Test recovery when handles become available
- **Expected**: Proper file handle management, fallback to console

**Test Case DT-PERFORMANCE-001**: Performance Degradation Under Load
- **Objective**: Validate performance requirements under stress
- **Method**:
  - Baseline: Measure operation time without logging
  - Stress: Log 100,000 messages/second for 5 minutes
  - Monitor: CPU usage, memory usage, I/O wait times
  - Measure: Average latency and 99th percentile response times
  - Compare: Overhead ratio against baseline
- **Expected**:
  - Performance overhead remains <4x baseline
  - System remains responsive under sustained load
  - No performance degradation over time
  - Memory usage stabilizes

**Test Case DT-PERFORMANCE-002**: Level Filtering Performance
- **Objective**: Validate IsLevelEnabled optimization
- **Method**:
  - Set log level to ERROR
  - Call IsLevelEnabled(Debug) 1,000,000 times
  - Measure execution time and CPU usage
  - Compare with and without level checking
- **Expected**:
  - Level checking is fast (<1Î¼s per call)
  - Debug operations are skipped efficiently
  - No unnecessary object allocation
