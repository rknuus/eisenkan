# LoggingUtility Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Service Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The LoggingUtility shall provide structured logging capabilities for all layers of the EisenKan system, enabling consistent event recording, contextual information capture, and arbitrary data type logging following Google's structured logging principles.

### 1.2 Architectural Classification
- **Layer**: Utilities
- **Type**: Utility Service
- **Volatility**: Infrastructure (Low volatility - logging patterns are stable)
- **Namespace**: `eisenkan.Utilities.LoggingUtility`

## 2. Business Requirements (EARS Format)

### 2.1 Core Logging Requirements

**REQ-LOG-001**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** record events with severity levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal) to enable filtering based on operational needs.

**REQ-LOG-002**: **WHEN** a component calls the logging service with structured context, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** capture all contextual information including component and operation.

**REQ-LOG-003**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** support multiple output destinations (console, file) simultaneously to accommodate different deployment environments.

**REQ-LOG-004**: **WHEN** an error logging operation is requested, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** automatically capture stack trace information to facilitate rapid problem resolution.

**REQ-LOG-005**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** provide level-based filtering checks to prevent expensive debug operations when not needed.

**REQ-LOG-006**: **WHEN** a log request is received, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** add a timestamp to avoid skewing timestamps if the requests are processed asynchronously.

### 2.2 Structured Logging Requirements (Based on Google Research)

**REQ-STRUCT-001**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** support logging of arbitrary data types (structs, maps, slices, primitives) as structured data.

**REQ-STRUCT-002**: **WHEN** logging structured data, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** preserve type information and hierarchical relationships to enable programmatic analysis.

**REQ-STRUCT-003**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** support logging of plain messages without any runtime-formatted data, because all additional data shall be passed as structured data.

**REQ-STRUCT-004**: **WHEN** generating log output, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** generate human-readable messages while maintaining machine-parseable structured data.

**REQ-FORMAT-001**: **WHEN** generating log output, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** format structured logs with timestamp, level, message, and structured data.

**REQ-FORMAT-003**: **WHILE** processing structured data, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** limit nested object depth to 5 levels to prevent output verbosity issues.

### 2.3 Quality Attributes

**REQ-PERF-001**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** introduce less than 4x performance overhead compared to baseline operations without logging.

**REQ-THREAD-001**: **WHILE** the system is operational, the LoggingUtility **SHALL** handle concurrent access from multiple execution contexts without data races or deadlocks.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-001**: **IF** log output fails, **THEN** the LoggingUtility **SHALL** crash the application.

**REQ-CONFIG-001**: **WHEN** the LoggingUtility starts, it **SHALL** read configuration from environment variables to support stateless design.

## 3. Service Contract Requirements

### 3.1 Interface Operations
The LoggingUtility shall provide the following operations:

1. **Log**: Record event
2. **LogError**: Record error with automatic stack trace capture
3. **IsLevelEnabled**: Check if log level would be output (performance optimization)

### 4.2 Data Contracts

**LogLevel Enumeration**:
- Debug (detailed development information)
- Info (general informational events)  
- Warning (concerning but non-critical issues)
- Error (error conditions requiring attention)
- Fatal (critical errors causing system failure)

**Log Structure**:
- Message: String narrative describing the logged event
- Component: String identifying the calling component
- Data: interface{} for arbitrary structured data

## 5. Technical Constraints

### 5.1 Technology Requirements
- Implementation Language: Go (matching project requirements)
- Output Formats: Human-readable with embedded JSON for structured data
- Configuration Method: Environment variables (stateless design)
- Dependencies: Go standard library only

### 5.2 Integration Requirements
- The LoggingUtility shall be callable from all architectural layers
- The LoggingUtility shall not create dependencies on other system components
- The LoggingUtility shall support graceful resource cleanup

### 5.3 Operational Requirements
- Environment Variables:
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls minimum log level
  - `LOG_FILE`: Optional file path for file logging
- Default Behavior: INFO level to console if no configuration provided

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### 6.1 Functional Acceptance
- All interface operations work as specified in contract
- Arbitrary Go types (structs, maps, slices, primitives) can be logged as structured data
- Environment variable configuration is properly applied
- Multiple output destinations work simultaneously

### 6.2 Quality Acceptance  
- Performance overhead is less than 4x baseline for typical operations
- No data races or deadlocks under concurrent load (100 goroutines, 1000 messages each)
- Service handles invalid file paths and permissions gracefully
- Structured logs contain narrative messages with embedded structured data

### 6.3 Structured Logging Acceptance
- Complex business objects are logged with preserved type information
- Machine-parseable structured data is embedded in human-readable format
- Nested object depth is limited to prevent verbosity

## 7. Design Constraints

### 7.1 Architectural Constraints
- Must follow iDesign utility service patterns
- Must not contain business logic or domain-specific functionality
- Must be stateless (configuration only, no business state)
- Must support interface-based design for testability

### 7.2 Structured Logging Constraints
- Must handle arbitrary types through reflection or type switching
- Must balance human readability with machine parseability
- Must prevent infinite recursion in self-referencing data structures
