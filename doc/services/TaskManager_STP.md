# TaskManager Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the TaskManager service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, subtask workflow orchestration testing, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [TaskManager_SRS.md](TaskManager_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations and workflow orchestration capabilities including hierarchical task management, subtask workflow coupling, and business rule integration.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- Memory and CPU profiling capabilities
- BoardAccess service for persistent storage operations
- RuleEngine service for business rule validation
- LoggingUtility service for operational logging
- Mock services for dependency failure testing
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- Rule set test data for subtask workflow coupling and hierarchy validation

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid task data, malformed hierarchical relationships, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, large task hierarchies, concurrent operations
- **Business Rule Violations**: Invalid subtask workflow coupling, hierarchy constraints, cascade policy violations
- **Workflow Orchestration Edge Cases**: Complex parent-child state transitions, concurrent subtask operations
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements REQ-TASKMANAGER-001 through REQ-TASKMANAGER-022 with negative cases
- **Priority Promotion Edge Cases**: Invalid promotion dates, concurrent promotion processing, promotion date validation failures
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation when dependencies fail
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions and consistency under concurrent workflow orchestration
- **IContext Facet Testing**: Context data validation, JSON serialization errors, git storage failures, malformed context data
