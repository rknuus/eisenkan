# ValidationUtility Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the ValidationUtility service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [ValidationUtility_SRS.md](ValidationUtility_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all validation operations including basic data types, format validation, business rules, and collection validation.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- UTF-8 text processing capabilities
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- Large dataset generation capabilities for performance testing

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, excessive validation rules, concurrent overload
- **Validation Logic Edge Cases**: Malformed patterns, circular references, contradictory rules
- **Data Type Boundary Testing**: Extreme values, format edge cases, encoding issues
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements with negative cases
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions under stress
