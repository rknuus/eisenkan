# RuleEngine Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the requirements for the RuleEngine service, an Engines layer component that provides business rule processing capabilities for the EisenKan system. The service encapsulates rule evaluation logic and provides atomic rule execution operations, enabling workflow customization and automated task management based on configurable business rules.

### 1.2 Scope
RuleEngine is responsible for:
- Business rule evaluation and execution based on task state and transitions
- Rule trigger detection and condition matching for workflow automation
- Rule priority ordering and dependency resolution
- Rule validation and conflict detection during evaluation
- Support for extensible rule categories (validation, workflow, automation, notification)

### 1.3 System Context
RuleEngine operates in the Engines layer of the EisenKan architecture, sitting between the Managers layer (TaskManager) and providing pure business logic for rule processing. It receives rule sets from RulesAccess and applies business logic to determine rule applicability and execution order to be performed on request of a manager.

## 2. Operations

The following operations define the required behavior for RuleEngine:

#### OP-1: Evaluate Rules for Task Event
**Actors**: TaskManager
**Trigger**: When a task state change
**Flow**:
1. Receive task event context
2. Fetch applicable rule set for the board/workflow
3. Filter rules based on trigger type and conditions
4. Evaluate rule conditions against task and event context
5. Return verdict whether task change can be applied

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Rule Evaluation Requirements

**REQ-RULEENGINE-001**: When a task event is provided, the RuleEngine shall evaluate whether the task change represented by the event can be applied or not.

**REQ-RULEENGINE-002**: When multiple rules match an event, the RuleEngine shall evaluate all matching rules ordered by priority (higher priority values first) and report all detected violations in one go.

## 4. Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Performance Requirements

**REQ-PERFORMANCE-001**: The RuleEngine shall complete rule evaluation for up to 100 rules within 500 milliseconds under normal load conditions on a MacAir M4.

### 4.2 Reliability Requirements

**REQ-RELIABILITY-001**: When rule evaluation encounters invalid rule definitions, the RuleEngine shall fail the operation with a helpful error.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-002**: The RuleEngine shall maintain stateless operation to ensure consistent rule evaluation results for identical inputs.

### 4.3 Usability Requirements

**REQ-USABILITY-001**: The RuleEngine shall provide clear error messages for all rule evaluation failures that include specific rule identification and condition details.

**REQ-USABILITY-002**: The RuleEngine shall accept rule data in the structured format defined by RulesAccess without format conversion.


### 4.4 Extensibility Requirements

**REQ-EXTENSIBILITY-001**: The RuleEngine shall support extensible trigger types to accommodate different workflow events (task transitions, due dates, status changes).

## 5. Service Contract Requirements

### 5.1 Interface Operations
The RuleEngine service shall provide the following behavioral operations:

- **Evaluate Task Change**: Accept task event context, return decision whether task change can be applied or not

### 5.2 Data Contracts
The service shall work with these conceptual data entities:

**Task Event Context**: Contains possible future task state, current state, and event type for rule evaluation.

**Rule Evaluation Result**: Verdict, whether the task change can be applied or not and list of reasons if not.

### 5.3 Error Handling
All errors shall include:
- Error code classification
- Human-readable error message  
- Technical details for debugging
- Suggested recovery actions where applicable
- Rule identification and context information when applicable

## 6. Technical Constraints

### 6.1 Integration Requirements
**REQ-INTEGRATION-001**: The RuleEngine service shall receive rule sets from ResourceAccess.

**REQ-INTEGRATION-002**: The RuleEngine service shall use the LoggingUtility service for all operational logging.

**REQ-INTEGRATION-003**: The RuleEngine service shall operate within the Engines architectural layer constraints and maintain stateless operation.

### 6.2 Data Format Requirements
**REQ-FORMAT-001**: The RuleEngine service shall process rule data in the format provided by RulesAccess without format transformation.

**REQ-FORMAT-002**: The RuleEngine service shall support rule condition expressions that can reference task properties and event context.

**REQ-FORMAT-003**: The RuleEngine service shall return rule evaluation results in structured format suitable for Manager layer orchestration.
