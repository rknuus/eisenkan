# VersioningUtility Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies for the VersioningUtility service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and destructive testing approaches for all EARS requirements specified in [VersioningUtility_SRS.md](VersioningUtility_SRS.md). Requirements verification and actual test execution results are documented in [VersioningUtility_STR.md](VersioningUtility_STR.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations and version control capabilities.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- File system with permission control capabilities
- Git repository testing utilities
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- Large file generation capabilities (up to 100MB)

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, file handle exhaustion, repository size limits
- **External Dependency Failures**: File system errors, permission issues, repository corruption
- **Configuration Corruption**: Invalid repository paths, corrupted git structures
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements with negative cases
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions and repository corruption under stress

## 3. Destructive API Test Cases
