# UIStateAccess Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines a comprehensive destructive testing strategy for the UIStateAccess service to validate robustness, reliability, and graceful failure handling under adverse conditions. The focus is on boundary violations, resource exhaustion, and error recovery scenarios that could compromise state data integrity or application stability.

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers all UIStateAccess interface operations with emphasis on:
- **State Data Corruption** - Malformed data, encoding issues, size violations
- **Storage System Failures** - Permission errors, disk full, network storage issues
- **Concurrent Access Violations** - Race conditions, file locking, atomic operation failures
- **Cross-Platform Edge Cases** - Platform-specific storage limitations and behaviors
- **Resource Exhaustion** - Memory pressure, storage limits, handle exhaustion
- **Performance Degradation** - Large datasets, slow storage, timeout scenarios

### 1.3 Test Strategy
Destructive testing methodology focusing on:
1. **API Contract Violations** - Invalid inputs, null parameters, malformed data
2. **Storage Boundary Testing** - File system limits, permission boundaries, corruption simulation
3. **Concurrency Stress Testing** - Multi-threaded access, file locking conflicts
4. **Platform-Specific Failure Modes** - OS-specific storage issues and recovery
5. **Performance Under Stress** - Large state datasets, storage latency, memory pressure
6. **Data Integrity Validation** - Corruption detection, recovery mechanisms, backup systems
