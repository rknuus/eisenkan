## 6. Issues and Findings

### 6.1 Issues Identified
**Test Coverage Gaps**:
1. **DT-ERROR-001**: Runtime evaluation errors not specifically tested in dedicated test scenarios
2. **DT-RECOVERY-001**: Service recovery from failures not implemented
3. **DT-RECOVERY-002**: Partial functionality under constraints not tested

**Note**: While these specific test cases are not implemented, error handling is partially covered through:
- Unit tests handle basic error conditions
- Integration tests verify component failures
- Acceptance tests include some error scenarios in API contract violations

### 6.2 Recommendations
1. **Complete STP Coverage**: Implement missing DT-ERROR-001, DT-RECOVERY-001, and DT-RECOVERY-002 test cases
2. **Runtime Error Testing**: Add dedicated tests for arithmetic overflow, memory access violations, and stack overflow scenarios
3. **Recovery Testing**: Add tests for recovery from RulesAccess failures, BoardAccess failures, and memory exhaustion
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Test partial functionality when dependencies are unavailable
5. **Memory Monitoring**: Current memory monitoring in ResourceExhaustion test shows system-dependent values that may not be portable
6. **Error Message Validation**: Enhance error message testing to verify specific error content and formatting

**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- ✅ Core functionality fully tested and working
- ✅ Performance requirements exceeded
- ✅ All EARS requirements verified
- ⚠️ 3/9 STP test cases not implemented (error handling and recovery scenarios)

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Service demonstrates high reliability and robustness for core functionality. Missing test coverage represents minor gaps in edge case validation rather than functional deficiencies.
