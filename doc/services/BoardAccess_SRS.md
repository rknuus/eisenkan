# BoardAccess Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the requirements for the BoardAccess service, a ResourceAccess layer component that provides persistent storage and retrieval capabilities for EisenKan tasks. The service encapsulates task data management and provides atomic business operations for task manipulation.

### 1.2 Scope
BoardAccess is responsible for:
- Persistent storage and retrieval of task data including hierarchical task relationships
- Version control integration for task history and change tracking  
- Atomic operations for task lifecycle management with subtask support
- Data consistency and integrity enforcement for parent-child task relationships
- Resource access abstraction for task-related operations

### 1.3 System Context
BoardAccess operates in the ResourceAccess layer of the EisenKan architecture, sitting between the business logic layers (Engines/Managers) and the resource layer (file system via VersioningUtility). It provides a stable API for task data operations while encapsulating the volatility of data storage mechanisms.

## 2. Operations

The following operations define the required behavior for BoardAccess:

#### OP-1: Store New Task
**Actors**: TaskManager, ValidationEngine
**Trigger**: When a new task is created in the system  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task data with required attributes and optional parent task identifier
2. Validate task data completeness and parent-child relationship constraints
3. Assign unique task identifier
4. Persist task to version-controlled storage with hierarchical relationship
5. Return task identifier and confirmation

#### OP-2: Retrieve Task
**Actors**: TaskManager
**Trigger**: When task data is needed for business operations  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task identifier request
2. Locate task in storage
3. Return complete task data or not found indication

2. Locate task and subtasks - if any - in storage
3. Archive or remove task and - depending on the policy - subtasks data
4. Return removal confirmation

2. Search task storage using criteria including hierarchical filters
3. Return matching task identifiers and data with optional hierarchical information

#### OP-6: Load Configuration (IConfiguration Facet)
**Actors**: TaskManager
**Trigger**: When board-level configuration data needs to be retrieved
**Flow**:
1. Receive configuration load request with configuration type and identifier
2. Access git-based JSON configuration storage
3. Parse and validate configuration data structure
4. Return configuration data including board settings, column definitions, and workflow rules

#### OP-7: Store Configuration (IConfiguration Facet)
**Actors**: TaskManager
**Trigger**: When board-level configuration data needs to be persisted
**Flow**:
1. Receive configuration store request with configuration data and type
2. Validate configuration data against schema requirements
3. Serialize configuration to JSON format
4. Store configuration through git-based storage with atomic operations and versioning
5. Return configuration storage confirmation
