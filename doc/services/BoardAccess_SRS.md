# BoardAccess Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the requirements for the BoardAccess service, a ResourceAccess layer component that provides persistent storage and retrieval capabilities for EisenKan tasks. The service encapsulates task data management and provides atomic business operations for task manipulation.

### 1.2 Scope
BoardAccess is responsible for:
- Persistent storage and retrieval of task data
- Version control integration for task history and change tracking  
- Atomic operations for task lifecycle management
- Data consistency and integrity enforcement
- Resource access abstraction for task-related operations

### 1.3 System Context
BoardAccess operates in the ResourceAccess layer of the EisenKan architecture, sitting between the business logic layers (Engines/Managers) and the resource layer (file system via VersioningUtility). It provides a stable API for task data operations while encapsulating the volatility of data storage mechanisms.

## 2. Use Cases

### 2.1 Primary Use Cases
The following use cases define the required behavior for BoardAccess:

#### UC-1: Store New Task
**Actors**: TaskManager, ValidationEngine
**Trigger**: When a new task is created in the system  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task data with required attributes
2. Validate task data completeness  
3. Assign unique task identifier
4. Persist task to version-controlled storage
5. Return task identifier and confirmation

#### UC-2: Retrieve Task
**Actors**: TaskManager
**Trigger**: When task data is needed for business operations  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task identifier request
2. Locate task in storage
3. Return complete task data or not found indication

#### UC-3: Update Task
**Actors**: TaskManager, ValidationEngine
**Trigger**: When task data needs modification  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task identifier and updated data
2. Validate update request
3. Apply changes to stored task
4. Create version history entry
5. Return update confirmation

#### UC-4: Remove Task  
**Actors**: TaskManager  
**Trigger**: When task should be deleted from system  
**Flow**:
1. Receive task identifier for removal
2. Locate task in storage
3. Archive or remove task data
4. Return removal confirmation

#### UC-5: Query Tasks by Criteria
**Actors**: TaskManager  
**Trigger**: When tasks need to be found by specific attributes  
**Flow**:
1. Receive query criteria (priority, status, tags, etc.)
2. Search task storage using criteria
3. Return matching task identifiers and data

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Task Storage Requirements

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-001**: When a valid task is provided, the BoardAccess service shall store the task data persistently with version control tracking.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-002**: When storing a task, the BoardAccess service shall generate a unique task identifier and return it to the caller.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-003**: When task data is incomplete or invalid, the BoardAccess service shall reject the storage request with a structured error message.

### 3.2 Task Retrieval Requirements  

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-004**: When a task identifier is provided, the BoardAccess service shall return the complete task data if it exists.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-005**: When a non-existent task identifier is requested, the BoardAccess service shall return a not-found indication without error.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-006**: The BoardAccess service shall support bulk retrieval of multiple tasks using a list of task identifiers.

### 3.3 Task Update Requirements

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-007**: When a valid task update request is provided, the BoardAccess service shall store the task data persistently with version control tracking.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-008**: When task update data is invalid (e.g. non-existent task identifier), the BoardAccess service shall reject the update and leave the original data unchanged.

### 3.4 Task Query Requirements

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-009**: The BoardAccess service shall support bulk retrieval of all task identifiers.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-010**: The BoardAccess service shall support querying tasks by priority level (urgent/important combinations).

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-011**: The BoardAccess service shall support querying tasks by workflow status.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-012**: When query criteria match no tasks, the BoardAccess service shall return an empty result set without error.

### 3.5 Task Removal Requirements

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-013**: When a task archive request is received, the BoardAccess service shall archive the task instead of permanently deleting it.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-015**: When a task removal request is received, the BoardAccess service shall permanently delete it.

**REQ-BOARDACCESS-014**: When removing a non-existent task, the BoardAccess service shall return success without error (idempotent operation).

## 4. Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Performance Requirements

**REQ-PERFORMANCE-001**: The BoardAccess service shall complete all single-task operations within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.

**REQ-PERFORMANCE-002**: The BoardAccess service shall support concurrent operations from multiple clients without data corruption.

### 4.2 Reliability Requirements  

**REQ-RELIABILITY-001**: When storage operations fail, the BoardAccess service shall return structured error information including failure reason and recovery suggestions.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-002**: The BoardAccess service shall maintain data consistency even when multiple operations are performed simultaneously.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-003**: When the underlying storage system is unavailable, the BoardAccess service shall fail gracefully with appropriate error messages.

### 4.3 Usability Requirements

**REQ-USABILITY-001**: The BoardAccess service shall provide clear error messages for all failure conditions that include specific information about what went wrong.

**REQ-USABILITY-002**: The BoardAccess service shall accept task data in a structured format that aligns with EisenKan domain models.

**REQ-USABILITY-003**: The change history generated by the TaskAccess shall allow tracing of creation, modification, and deletion of tasks.

**REQ-USABILITY-004**: The file format used to store data persistently shall not leak through the service interface.

## 5. Service Contract Requirements

### 5.1 Interface Operations
The BoardAccess service shall provide the following behavioral operations:

- **Create Task**: Accept task data and return unique identifier with success confirmation
- **Retrieve Single Task**: Accept task identifier and return complete task data or not-found indication
- **List Task Identifiers**: Return list with identifiers of all tasks
- **Get Tasks Data**: Accept list of task identifiers and return corresponding task data
