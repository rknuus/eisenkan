# FormatUtility Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the FormatUtility service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [FormatUtility_SRS.md](FormatUtility_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all text formatting, data formatting, and input sanitization operations.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- UTF-8 text processing capabilities
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- Large dataset generation capabilities

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, oversized text processing, concurrent overload
- **Edge Case Text Processing**: Unicode edge cases, malformed text, encoding issues
- **Data Type Boundary Testing**: Extreme numeric values, invalid dates, edge case formatting
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements with negative cases
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions under stress
