# TaskAccess Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the TaskAccess service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [TaskAccess_SRS.md](TaskAccess_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations and task data management capabilities.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- File system with permission control capabilities
- VersioningUtility service for version control testing
- LoggingUtility service for operational logging
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- JSON file manipulation capabilities

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, file handle exhaustion, concurrent limits
- **External Dependency Failures**: VersioningUtility failures, file system errors, permission issues
- **Configuration Corruption**: Invalid JSON data, corrupted task files
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements with negative cases
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions and data corruption under stress
