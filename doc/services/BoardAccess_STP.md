# BoardAccess Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the BoardAccess service. The plan emphasizes API boundary testing, error condition validation, and complete traceability to all EARS requirements specified in [BoardAccess_SRS.md](BoardAccess_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive API testing, requirements verification, error condition handling, resource exhaustion scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations including task data management capabilities (hierarchical task relationships, subtask support, priority promotion date functionality) and IBoard facet operations for board discovery, metadata management, lifecycle operations, and configuration management.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- File system with permission control capabilities
- VersioningUtility service for version control testing
- RuleEngine service for board configuration validation testing
- LoggingUtility service for operational logging
- Memory and resource monitoring tools
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)
- JSON file manipulation capabilities
- Git repository with configuration test data and multiple board structures
- Configuration data validation tools for JSON schema testing
- Directory structure manipulation tools for board discovery testing

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **API Contract Violations**: Invalid, extreme, and malformed inputs, boundary violations, type mismatches
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory limits, file handle exhaustion, concurrent limits
- **External Dependency Failures**: VersioningUtility failures, file system errors, permission issues
- **Configuration Corruption**: Invalid JSON data, corrupted task files, malformed configuration data
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all EARS requirements REQ-BOARDACCESS-001 through REQ-BOARDACCESS-049 with negative cases
- **Priority Promotion Data Testing**: Invalid promotion dates, date format validation, promotion date queries
- **IBoard Facet Testing**: Board discovery failures, metadata corruption, lifecycle operation failures, configuration validation errors
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Test graceful degradation and recovery
- **Concurrency Stress Testing**: Test race conditions and data corruption under stress
