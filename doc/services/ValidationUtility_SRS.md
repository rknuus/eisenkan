# ValidationUtility Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the requirements for the ValidationUtility service, a Client Utilities layer component that provides universal input validation operations for any application. The service enables consistent data validation, format checking, and business rule enforcement operations that are technology-agnostic and reusable across different domains.

### 1.2 Scope
ValidationUtility is responsible for:
- Basic data type validation (strings, numbers, booleans, dates)
- Format validation (email, URL, phone, identifiers)
- Business rule validation (required fields, constraints, cross-field validation)
- Collection validation (arrays, maps, uniqueness)
- Custom validation rules and pattern matching
- Validation result reporting with detailed error information

### 1.3 System Context
ValidationUtility operates in the Client Utilities layer of the EisenKan architecture, providing validation services to all other client layers (Managers, Engines, ResourceAccess). It provides stable APIs for common validation operations while encapsulating the volatility of validation rule implementation details.

## 2. Operations

The following operations define the required behavior for ValidationUtility:

#### OP-1: Validate Basic Data Types
**Actors**: All client components
**Trigger**: When a component needs to validate basic data type constraints
**Flow**:
1. Receive validation request with value and data type constraints
2. Apply appropriate validation rules based on data type
3. Return validation result with success/failure and error details
4. Handle edge cases (nil values, type conversion requirements)

#### OP-2: Validate Formats
**Actors**: All client components
**Trigger**: When a component needs to validate format patterns (email, URL, etc.)
**Flow**:
1. Receive format validation request with value and format type
2. Apply format-specific validation rules
3. Return validation result indicating format compliance
4. Provide detailed error information for format violations

#### OP-3: Validate Business Rules
**Actors**: All client components
**Trigger**: When a component needs to enforce business logic constraints
**Flow**:
1. Receive business rule validation request with context data
2. Apply business logic validation (required fields, cross-field rules)
3. Return comprehensive validation result for all applicable rules
4. Support conditional and contextual validation scenarios

#### OP-4: Validate Collections
**Actors**: All client components
**Trigger**: When a component needs to validate arrays, slices, or maps
**Flow**:
1. Receive collection validation request with collection data and rules
2. Apply collection-level validation (size, uniqueness, element validation)
3. Validate individual elements within the collection
4. Return aggregated validation results for collection and elements

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.3 Business Rule Validation Requirements

**REQ-BUSINESS-001**: When a component requests required field validation, the ValidationUtility shall validate that required fields contain non-empty, non-nil values.

**REQ-BUSINESS-002**: When a component requests conditional validation, the ValidationUtility shall apply validation rules based on the values of other fields in the validation context.

**REQ-BUSINESS-003**: When a component requests cross-field validation, the ValidationUtility shall validate relationships between multiple fields (e.g., end date after start date).

**REQ-BUSINESS-004**: When a component requests enumeration validation, the ValidationUtility shall validate values against predefined allowed value sets.

### 3.4 Collection Validation Requirements

**REQ-COLLECTION-001**: When a component requests array validation, the ValidationUtility shall validate array size constraints and apply element validation rules to each array member.

**REQ-COLLECTION-002**: When a component requests map validation, the ValidationUtility shall validate required keys and apply value validation rules to map values.

**REQ-COLLECTION-003**: When a component requests uniqueness validation, the ValidationUtility shall detect duplicate values within collections and across related fields.

**REQ-COLLECTION-004**: While processing collection validation, the ValidationUtility shall provide detailed error information indicating which elements or keys failed validation.

## 4. Quality Attributes
