# RulesAccess Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the requirements for the RulesAccess service, a ResourceAccess layer component that provides persistent storage and retrieval capabilities for EisenKan business rules. The service encapsulates rule data management and provides atomic operations for rule manipulation, enabling workflow customization and business process automation.

### 1.2 Scope
RulesAccess is responsible for:
- Persistent storage and retrieval of business rules and triggers
- Version control integration for rule history and change tracking
- Atomic operations for rule lifecycle management
- Data consistency and integrity enforcement for rule definitions
- Resource access abstraction for rule-related operations
- Support for workflow customization patterns (Scrum, SAFe, etc.)

### 1.3 System Context
RulesAccess operates in the ResourceAccess layer of the EisenKan architecture, sitting between the Rule Engine and the underlying storage layer (Rules Repo via VersioningUtility). It provides a stable API for rule data operations while encapsulating the volatility of rule storage mechanisms and formats.

## 2. Operations

The following operations define the required behavior for RulesAccess:

#### OP-1: Retrieve Rules
**Actors**: Rule Engine
**Trigger**: When rule definitions are needed for business operations
**Flow**:
1. Receive request for rule set with board directory path
2. Locate rule set in the specified directory
3. Return complete rule data for all rules in the board directory
4. Return empty rule set if no rules are configured

#### OP-2: Validate Rules
**Actors**: Rule Engine, TaskManager
**Trigger**: When rule definitions need validation before storage
**Flow**:
1. Receive complete rule set for validation
2. Parse and validate rule syntax against schema
3. Check for semantic consistency and rule conflicts
4. Validate rule dependencies and circular references
5. Return validation result with detailed error information if validation fails

#### OP-3: Store Rules
**Actors**: Rule Engine, TaskManager
**Trigger**: When validated rule definitions need to be persisted
**Flow**:
1. Receive complete rule set for storage
2. Validate rule set completeness and correctness
3. If validation passes, persist entire rule set to version-controlled storage
4. If validation fails, reject storage with detailed error information
5. Return storage confirmation or rejection with validation errors

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Rule Retrieval Requirements

**REQ-RULESACCESS-001**: When a rule set is requested with a board directory path, the RulesAccess service shall return the complete rule data for all rules configured in that directory.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-002**: When no rule set is configured in the specified directory, the RulesAccess service shall return an empty rule set without error.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-003**: The RulesAccess service shall support retrieval from version-controlled storage with change history preservation.

### 3.2 Rule Validation Requirements

**REQ-RULESACCESS-004**: When a rule set is provided for validation, the RulesAccess service shall validate the rule syntax against the defined schema.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-005**: When rule validation fails, the RulesAccess service shall return detailed error information including syntax errors, semantic issues, and rule conflicts.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-006**: The RulesAccess service shall validate rule dependencies and circular references during validation.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-007**: The RulesAccess service shall validate rule set completeness to ensure all required rule categories are present.

### 3.3 Rule Storage Requirements

**REQ-RULESACCESS-008**: When a valid rule set is provided for storage, the RulesAccess service shall store the complete rule set persistently with version control tracking.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-009**: When storing a rule set, the RulesAccess service shall validate the rule set before persistence and reject invalid rule sets.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-010**: When rule set storage fails due to validation errors, the RulesAccess service shall return structured error messages detailing all validation failures.

**REQ-RULESACCESS-011**: The RulesAccess service shall replace the entire rule set atomically, ensuring consistency during updates.

## 4. Quality Attributes

### 4.1 Performance Requirements

**REQ-PERFORMANCE-001**: The RulesAccess service shall complete all operations within 2 seconds under normal load conditions for up to 1000 rules.

**REQ-PERFORMANCE-002**: The RulesAccess service shall support concurrent operations from multiple clients without data corruption.

### 4.2 Reliability Requirements

**REQ-RELIABILITY-001**: When storage operations fail, the RulesAccess service shall return error information.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-002**: The RulesAccess service shall maintain data consistency even when multiple rule operations are performed simultaneously.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-003**: When the underlying storage system is unavailable, the RulesAccess service shall fail gracefully with appropriate error messages.

**REQ-RELIABILITY-004**: The RulesAccess service shall detect and prevent rule conflicts that could lead to infinite loops or contradictory behavior during validation.

### 4.3 Usability Requirements

**REQ-USABILITY-001**: The RulesAccess service shall provide clear error messages for all failure conditions that include specific information about what went wrong.

**REQ-USABILITY-002**: The RulesAccess service shall accept rule data in a structured format that aligns with common business rule patterns.

**REQ-USABILITY-003**: The change history generated by the RulesAccess service shall allow tracing of rule creation, modification, and deletion.

**REQ-USABILITY-004**: The rule storage format used shall not leak through the service interface.

### 4.4 Extensibility Requirements

**REQ-EXTENSIBILITY-001**: The RulesAccess service shall support extensible rule schema to accommodate different workflow methodologies (Scrum, SAFe, Kanban, etc.).

**REQ-EXTENSIBILITY-002**: The RulesAccess service shall allow rule categories to be extended without requiring service modification.

## 5. Service Contract Requirements

### 5.1 Interface Operations
The RulesAccess service shall provide the following behavioral operations:

- **Read Rules**: Accept board directory path and return complete rule data for all rules configured in that directory
- **Validate Rule Changes**: Accept complete rule set and return validation result with detailed error information if validation fails
- **Change Rules**: Accept complete rule set, validate it, and if validation passes, store it persistently with version control tracking

### 5.2 Data Contracts
The service shall work with these conceptual data entities:

**Rule Set Entity**: Contains the complete collection of rules for a board directory including rule definitions, metadata, and configuration information.

**Rule Definition Entity**: Contains rule identification, trigger conditions, actions/effects, scope specifications, category classification, priority level, and optional metadata for extensions.

**Validation Result Entity**: Contains validation status, error details, conflict information, and suggestions for rule set corrections.

**Rule Category**: Represents rule classification (validation, workflow, automation, notification) for organizational purposes.

**Rule Trigger**: Defines conditions that activate rule execution including event types, timing constraints, and context requirements.

### 5.3 Error Handling
All errors shall include:
- Error code classification
- Human-readable error message
- Technical details for debugging
- Suggested recovery actions where applicable
- Rule validation error details with specific rule identification when applicable

## 6. Technical Constraints

### 6.1 Integration Requirements
**REQ-INTEGRATION-001**: The RulesAccess service shall use the VersioningUtility service for all persistent storage operations.

**REQ-INTEGRATION-002**: The RulesAccess service shall use the LoggingUtility service for all operational logging.

**REQ-INTEGRATION-003**: The RulesAccess service shall operate within the ResourceAccess architectural layer constraints.

### 6.2 Data Format Requirements
**REQ-FORMAT-001**: The RulesAccess service shall store rule data in JSON format for human readability and version control compatibility.
