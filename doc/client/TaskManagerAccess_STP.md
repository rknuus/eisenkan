# TaskManagerAccess Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Test Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines destructive testing strategies and comprehensive requirements verification for the TaskManagerAccess component. The plan emphasizes async operation boundary testing, error translation validation, UI integration testing, and complete traceability to all functional requirements specified in [TaskManagerAccess_SRS.md](TaskManagerAccess_SRS.md).

### 1.2 Scope
Testing covers destructive async operations, error handling validation, timeout management, data transformation integrity, cache coordination scenarios, and graceful degradation validation for all interface operations and UI integration patterns within the Access layer architecture.

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements
- Go 1.24.3+ runtime environment with race detector support
- Fyne UI framework testing support
- TaskManager service with mock implementation capability
- CacheUtility with configurable behavior for testing
- LoggingUtility integration for operation tracking
- Context cancellation and timeout testing infrastructure
- Concurrent execution environment (goroutine support)

## 2. Test Strategy

This STP emphasizes breaking the system through:
- **Async Operation Violations**: Channel mishandling, goroutine leaks, context timeout failures
- **Error Translation Failures**: Invalid error categorization, missing recovery suggestions, malformed UI responses
- **Data Transformation Edge Cases**: Type conversion failures, UI format violations, invalid TaskManager data
- **Cache Coordination Violations**: Cache invalidation failures, data consistency issues, concurrent access problems
- **Service Integration Edge Cases**: TaskManager unavailability, response timeout scenarios, service error conditions
- **Requirements Verification Tests**: Validate all functional requirements REQ-TASKACCESS-001 through REQ-TASKACCESS-010
- **UI Integration Stress Testing**: Channel handling under concurrent access, context deadline management
- **Performance Boundary Testing**: Response time violations, memory usage under load
