# TaskWidget Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TaskWidget component, with emphasis on destructive testing scenarios that validate component resilience, error handling, and graceful degradation under adverse conditions.

### 1.2 Scope
This STP covers testing of TaskWidget functionality including task display operations, user interaction handling, workflow coordination, drag-drop operations, data synchronization, and error recovery mechanisms. Testing focuses on validating all 30 requirements from TaskWidget SRS through both positive and negative test scenarios.

### 1.3 Test Strategy
Testing employs destructive testing methodology to validate component behavior under stress, error conditions, and resource constraints. Test execution validates requirements compliance while ensuring robust operation under adverse conditions.
