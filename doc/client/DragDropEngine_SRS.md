# DragDropEngine Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the DragDropEngine service, an Engine layer component that provides drag-and-drop coordination for kanban-style task management interfaces in the EisenKan application.

### 1.2 Scope
DragDropEngine bridges Fyne's basic draggable interface with complex inter-container movement requirements, enabling intuitive task organization through direct manipulation. The service focuses on spatial coordination, visual feedback management, and safe state transitions during drag operations.

### 1.3 System Context
DragDropEngine operates within the Engine layer of the EisenKan system architecture, following iDesign methodology principles:
- **Namespace**: eisenkan.Client.Engines.DragDropEngine
- **Dependencies**: FyneUtility (client utilities)
- **Integration**: Provides drag-drop services to client managers and UI components
- **Enables**: ColumnWidget, BoardView task movement functionality

## 2. Operations

The following operations define the required behavior for DragDropEngine:

#### OP-1: Initiate Drag Operation
**Actors**: TaskWidget, UI managers requiring drag initiation
**Trigger**: When user begins dragging a task widget to move it to a different location
**Flow**:
1. Receive drag start signal from task widget
2. Create visual drag indicator representation
3. Initialize drag state tracking
4. Register drag operation with drop zone monitoring
5. Return drag operation handle for state management

#### OP-2: Coordinate Drop Zone Navigation
**Actors**: UI managers, ColumnWidget drop zones
**Trigger**: When dragged task moves over potential drop locations
**Flow**:
1. Receive drag position updates from UI system
2. Evaluate current drop zone validity based on spatial relationships
3. Provide visual feedback for valid/invalid drop targets
4. Update drop zone highlighting and acceptance indicators
5. Return current drop zone status and validation results

#### OP-3: Execute Drop Completion
**Actors**: TaskWorkflowManager, UI managers coordinating task movement
**Trigger**: When user releases dragged task to complete the move operation
**Flow**:
1. Receive drop completion signal with final position
2. Validate drop location against registered drop zones
3. Coordinate with TaskWorkflowManager for actual task movement
4. Clean up visual indicators and drag state
5. Return drop operation result with success/failure status

#### OP-4: Handle Drag Cancellation
**Actors**: UI managers handling escape conditions
**Trigger**: When drag operation needs to be cancelled due to invalid drop or user cancellation
**Flow**:
1. Detect cancellation conditions (invalid drop, escape key, UI state changes)
2. Return dragged task to original position with visual feedback
3. Remove all visual feedback indicators and highlights
4. Reset drag state and cleanup operation resources
5. Return cancellation status with restoration confirmation
