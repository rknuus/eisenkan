# ColumnWidget Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines the comprehensive testing strategy for the ColumnWidget component, with emphasis on destructive testing scenarios that validate component resilience, drag-drop coordination, layout performance, and graceful degradation under adverse conditions.

### 1.2 Scope
This STP covers testing of ColumnWidget functionality including task collection display, column-level interactions, drag-drop coordination with engines, layout management, state synchronization, and error recovery mechanisms. Testing focuses on validating all 37 requirements from ColumnWidget SRS through both positive and negative test scenarios.

### 1.3 Test Strategy
Testing employs destructive testing methodology to validate component behavior under stress, error conditions, and resource constraints. Test execution validates requirements compliance while ensuring robust operation under adverse conditions including engine failures, large task collections, and concurrent operations.
