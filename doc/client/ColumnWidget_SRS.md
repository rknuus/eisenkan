# ColumnWidget Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the ColumnWidget component, a UI element in the Client layer that displays a collection of tasks within a vertical column layout for the EisenKan kanban board system. The ColumnWidget serves as a container for TaskWidget instances and handles column-level operations including task arrangement, drag-drop coordination, and workflow integration.

### 1.2 Scope
ColumnWidget is a reusable UI component that integrates with WorkflowManager for task operations, DragDropEngine for spatial drag-drop mechanics, LayoutEngine for responsive layout management, and FyneUtility for consistent UI styling. The component focuses on task collection display, column-level operations, and drag-drop coordination while maintaining proper architectural layer separation and providing clean interfaces for parent BoardView containers.

### 1.3 System Context
ColumnWidget operates within the Client UI layer of the EisenKan system architecture:
- **Namespace**: eisenkan.Client.UI.ColumnWidget
- **Dependencies**: WorkflowManager (ITask facet), DragDropEngine (IDrag, IDrop, IVisualize facets), LayoutEngine (IKanban facet), FyneUtility
