# Application Root Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the requirements for the Application Root component, which provides the main application controller and view management for the EisenKan desktop application. It serves as the primary entry point that coordinates navigation between BoardSelectionView and BoardView components.

### 1.2 Scope
The Application Root serves as the top-level application controller that manages view transitions, handles application lifecycle events, and coordinates the main user workflow between board selection and board management within the EisenKan desktop application using the Fyne framework.

### 1.3 System Context
Application Root integrates with BoardSelectionView for board discovery and selection, BoardView for task management display, and Fyne framework for desktop application lifecycle management to provide a complete desktop application experience within the EisenKan system architecture.

## 2. Operations

### 2.1 Core Operations

**OP-1: Application Startup and Window Management**
- Initialize Fyne desktop application with main window
- Configure window properties (title, size, position)
- Display BoardSelectionView as initial screen
- Handle window lifecycle events

**OP-2: Board Selection Workflow**
- Present BoardSelectionView for board discovery and selection
- Listen for board selection events from BoardSelectionView
- Transition to BoardView when valid board is selected
- Handle board creation events and navigation

**OP-3: Board View Navigation**
- Initialize BoardView with selected board path
- Call BoardView.LoadBoard() when transitioning to board view
- Manage BoardView display and integration
- Provide navigation back to board selection

**OP-4: View Transition Management**
- Handle smooth transitions between BoardSelectionView and BoardView
- Manage view state during transitions
- Coordinate view cleanup and initialization
- Maintain navigation state

**OP-5: Application Lifecycle Management**
- Handle application shutdown requests (window close, keyboard shortcuts)
- Coordinate clean shutdown across all components
- Manage application exit workflow
- Handle emergency shutdown scenarios

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Application Startup Requirements

**AR-REQ-001**: When the EisenKan application is launched, the system shall initialize a Fyne desktop application with a main window.

**AR-REQ-002**: When the main window is created, the system shall set the window title to "EisenKan" and configure appropriate default window dimensions.

**AR-REQ-003**: When the application starts, the system shall display the BoardSelectionView as the initial screen.

**AR-REQ-004**: When the application is initialized, the system shall register appropriate keyboard shortcuts for application control.

### 3.2 Board Selection Workflow Requirements

**AR-REQ-005**: When BoardSelectionView signals a board selection event, the system shall transition to BoardView with the selected board path.

**AR-REQ-006**: When BoardSelectionView signals a board creation event, the system shall transition to BoardView with the newly created board path.

**AR-REQ-007**: When transitioning to BoardView, the system shall call BoardView.LoadBoard() to initialize the board display.

**AR-REQ-008**: When board selection occurs, the system shall hide BoardSelectionView and display BoardView in the main window.

### 3.3 Board View Navigation Requirements

**AR-REQ-009**: When displaying BoardView, the system shall provide a navigation mechanism to return to BoardSelectionView.

**AR-REQ-010**: When the user requests return to board selection, the system shall hide BoardView and display BoardSelectionView.

**AR-REQ-011**: When transitioning from BoardView to BoardSelectionView, the system shall call BoardSelectionView.RefreshBoards() to update the board list.

**AR-REQ-012**: When BoardView is displayed, the system shall set the window title to include the current board name.

**AR-REQ-013**: When navigating between views, the system shall maintain window size and position consistency.

### 3.4 View Transition Requirements

**AR-REQ-014**: When transitioning between views, the system shall complete the transition within 500ms under normal conditions.

**AR-REQ-015**: When a view transition is in progress, the system shall prevent additional transition requests until the current transition completes.

**AR-REQ-016**: When transitioning views, the system shall ensure the previous view is properly cleaned up before displaying the new view.

**AR-REQ-017**: When view transitions fail, the system shall display an error message and remain on the current view.

**AR-REQ-018**: When views are swapped, the system shall maintain proper keyboard focus and accessibility states.

### 3.5 Application Lifecycle Requirements

**AR-REQ-019**: When the user closes the main window, the system shall initiate application shutdown.

**AR-REQ-020**: When the user presses the OS-specific quit shortcut (Ctrl+Q/Cmd+Q), the system shall initiate application shutdown.

**AR-REQ-021**: When application shutdown is initiated, the system shall call cleanup methods on all active components.

**AR-REQ-022**: When shutdown is in progress, the system shall prevent new operations and complete shutdown within 2 seconds.

**AR-REQ-023**: When the application shuts down, the system shall ensure all resources are properly released.

### 3.6 Error Handling Requirements

**AR-REQ-024**: When a component reports a fatal error, the system shall display an error dialog and exit.

**AR-REQ-025**: When view initialization fails, the system shall display an error message and exit.

**AR-REQ-026**: When navigation errors occur, the system shall log the error and maintain the current view state.

**AR-REQ-027**: When the application encounters unexpected errors, the system shall display an error dialog and exit.

**AR-REQ-028**: When error dialogs are displayed, the system shall provide clear error messages and actionable recovery options.

## 4. Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Application Control Interface
**AR-INT-001**: The system shall provide a StartApplication operation to initialize and run the desktop application.

**AR-INT-002**: The system shall provide a ShutdownApplication operation to cleanly terminate the application.

**AR-INT-003**: The system shall provide a GetCurrentView operation to retrieve the currently displayed view state.

### 4.2 Navigation Interface
**AR-INT-004**: The system shall provide a ShowBoardSelection operation to display the BoardSelectionView.

**AR-INT-005**: The system shall provide a ShowBoardView operation that accepts a board path parameter.

**AR-INT-006**: The system shall provide a NavigateBack operation to return to the previous view.

### 4.3 Event Handler Interface
**AR-INT-007**: The system shall provide callback registration for board selection events from BoardSelectionView.

**AR-INT-008**: The system shall provide callback registration for board creation events from BoardSelectionView.

**AR-INT-009**: The system shall provide callback registration for navigation requests from BoardView.

**AR-INT-010**: The system shall provide callback registration for application exit events from any component.

### 4.4 Window Management Interface
**AR-INT-011**: The system shall provide a SetWindowTitle operation to update the main window title.

**AR-INT-012**: The system shall provide a GetWindowSize operation to retrieve current window dimensions.
