# BoardView Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the requirements for the BoardView component, which provides the primary kanban board interface with a 4-column Eisenhower Matrix layout for comprehensive task management and workflow coordination.

### 1.2 Scope
The BoardView serves as the main workspace component that coordinates multiple ColumnWidget instances, integrates TaskWidget components for task display, and orchestrates task workflow management across priority columns through drag-drop operations and business rule validation.

### 1.3 System Context
BoardView integrates with WorkflowManager for business logic coordination, ColumnWidget for column management, TaskWidget for task display, and FormValidationEngine for operation validation to provide a comprehensive kanban board experience within the EisenKan system.
