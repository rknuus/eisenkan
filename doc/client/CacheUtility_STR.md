## 3. Destructive Test Execution Results

### 3.1 API Contract Violations (14 Tests)
**All 14 tests PASSED** - Invalid inputs handled gracefully without crashes:

- **Invalid Set Operations** (6 tests): Empty keys, long keys, nil values, negative/zero/max TTL
- **Invalid Get Operations** (4 tests): Empty keys, non-existent keys, long keys, empty cache access
- **Invalid Pattern Operations** (4 tests): Empty patterns, invalid regex, complex patterns, wildcard patterns

**Key Result**: All edge cases handled without system failure or data corruption.

### 3.2 Resource Exhaustion Testing (9 Tests)
**All 9 tests PASSED** - System maintains stability under extreme resource pressure:

- **Memory Exhaustion** (4 tests): Beyond max size, large values, rapid allocation cycles, fragmentation
- **Concurrent Access** (5 tests): 1000+ concurrent Set/Get operations, mixed operations, config changes, cleanup

**Key Result**: LRU eviction activates properly, no memory leaks detected, graceful degradation under load.

### 3.3 TTL and Expiration Edge Cases (9 Tests)
**All 9 tests PASSED** - Precise expiration handling in all scenarios:

- **Time Boundary Conditions** (5 tests): Expiration at access time, microsecond precision, clock adjustments
- **Cleanup Operations** (4 tests): Thousands of expired entries, concurrent cleanup, cleanup during operations

**Key Result**: Accurate TTL management with proper cleanup efficiency.

### 3.4 Data Integrity and Corruption Prevention (4 Tests)
**All 4 tests PASSED** - No data corruption under concurrent access:

- **Concurrent Modifications** (4 tests): Same key modifications, eviction during reads, pattern invalidation during sets, statistics access

**Key Result**: Thread-safe operations maintain data consistency.

### 3.5 Configuration Boundary Testing (4 Tests)
**All 4 tests PASSED** - Invalid configurations handled safely:

- **Invalid Values** (3 tests): Zero/negative max size, negative TTL
- **Configuration Changes** (1 test): Config changes during active operations

**Key Result**: Invalid configurations rejected without affecting system stability.

### 3.6 Pattern Matching Robustness (4 Tests)
**All 4 tests PASSED** - Pattern operations remain performant and accurate:

- **Complex Scenarios** (4 tests): Special characters, overlapping patterns, Unicode keys, long match sets

**Key Result**: Pattern matching handles edge cases without performance degradation.

### 3.7 Performance and Memory Tests (7 Tests)
**All 7 tests PASSED** - Performance requirements met:

- **Performance Requirements**: Get operations: 222ns, Set operations: 665ns (both well under SRS limits)
- **Memory Management**: Memory leak test shows effective garbage collection
- **LRU Behavior**: Proper least-recently-used eviction logic
- **Shutdown Behavior**: Graceful cleanup without hanging

**Key Result**: All performance requirements exceeded with robust memory management.
