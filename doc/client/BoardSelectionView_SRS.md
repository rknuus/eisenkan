# BoardSelectionView Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the requirements for the BoardSelectionView component, which provides the board browsing, selection, and management interface for the EisenKan application. It serves as the primary entry point where users discover, manage, and select boards to work with.

### 1.2 Scope
The BoardSelectionView serves as the initial application workspace that presents available boards to users, enables board management operations (create, edit, delete), and coordinates board selection through integration with OS "recently used" mechanisms, TaskManager for validation, and FormattingEngine to provide a comprehensive board discovery experience within the EisenKan system.

### 1.3 System Context
BoardSelectionView integrates with OS "recently used" mechanisms for known board retrieval, TaskManager's board operations (OP-9 to OP-13) for comprehensive board management, FormattingEngine for data presentation and formatting, and Application Root for navigation and transition management to provide a complete board selection workflow within the EisenKan system architecture.

## 2. Operations

### 2.1 Core Operations

**OP-1: Board Discovery and Display**
- Display list of known boards with metadata (title, type, last modified)
- Browse file system for new board locations (git repositories with specific structure)
- Validate discovered directories through TaskManager integration
- Register newly discovered boards for future access
- Persist discovered boards using OS-specific "recently used" mechanisms
- Handle invalid or corrupted board structures gracefully
- Support board filtering and searching by name, type, or tags
- Provide sorting capabilities (name, date, usage frequency)
- Handle empty board collections gracefully

**OP-2: Board Selection Workflow**
- Enable board selection with visual feedback
- Support recent boards quick access (5 most recent)
- Signal board selection to Application Root for navigation
- Handle board selection validation and error states

**OP-3: Board Management Operations**
- Create new boards with name and type validation
- Edit board metadata (name, description, tags)
- Delete boards with confirmation workflow

**OP-4: Application Integration**
- Support application exit through keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Q/Cmd+Q)
- Handle window close events appropriately
- Provide callback interfaces for parent component integration
- Manage component lifecycle and cleanup

**OP-5: Data Formatting and Presentation**
- Format dates and times for display consistency
- Format board metadata and descriptions
- Support search result highlighting
- Handle text truncation and overflow
