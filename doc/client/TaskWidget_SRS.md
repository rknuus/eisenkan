# TaskWidget Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the TaskWidget component, a UI element in the Client layer that displays individual task information in the EisenKan kanban board system. The TaskWidget serves as the primary visual representation of tasks within the board interface.

### 1.2 Scope
TaskWidget is a reusable UI component that integrates with WorkflowManager for task operations, FormattingEngine for text presentation, and FormValidationEngine for input validation. The component focuses on task visualization, user interaction handling, inline editing, task creation, and workflow coordination while maintaining proper architectural layer separation and providing a clean interface for parent containers.

### 1.3 System Context
TaskWidget operates within the Client UI layer of the EisenKan system architecture:
- **Namespace**: eisenkan.Client.UI.TaskWidget
- **Dependencies**: WorkflowManager (ITask and IDrag facets), FormattingEngine (Text and Metadata facets), FormValidationEngine (form input validation)
- **Integration**: Embedded within ColumnWidget, BoardView, and CreateTaskDialog components
