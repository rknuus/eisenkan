# CreateTaskDialog Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This SRS defines the requirements for the CreateTaskDialog component, which provides a modal Eisenhower Matrix interface for task creation with integrated drag-and-drop task management capabilities.

### 1.2 Scope
The CreateTaskDialog provides a focused task creation experience within an Eisenhower Matrix context, allowing users to create new tasks in the "non-urgent non-important" quadrant and immediately organize them into appropriate priority quadrants through drag-and-drop interactions.

### 1.3 System Context
CreateTaskDialog integrates with the enhanced TaskWidget, WorkflowManager, FormValidationEngine, LayoutEngine, and DragDropEngine to provide comprehensive task creation and organization functionality within a modal dialog interface.
