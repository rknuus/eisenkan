## 5. Issues Identified and Resolved

### 5.1 Workflow ID Collision Issue
**Issue**: During stress testing with 100 concurrent workflows, duplicate workflow IDs were detected

**Resolution**: Implemented collision detection and counter-based unique ID generation
**Verification**: TestSTP_WorkflowStateManagementStress now passes with 100% unique IDs

**Before Fix**:
```
workflow_manager_stp_test.go:415: Duplicate workflow ID detected: task_create_1758272027240870000
```

**After Fix**:
```
workflow_manager_stp_test.go:425: Created 100 unique workflows with 0 errors under stress
--- PASS: TestSTP_WorkflowStateManagementStress (0.00s)
```
