# Application Root Software Test Plan (STP)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Test Plan defines the testing strategy and test cases for the Application Root component, focusing on destructive testing to validate robustness, error handling, and edge case behavior in view management, navigation, and application lifecycle operations.

### 1.2 Scope
This STP covers comprehensive testing of Application Root including view transition failures, component integration errors, application lifecycle edge cases, resource exhaustion scenarios, and malformed event handling to ensure reliable operation under adverse conditions.

### 1.3 Test Strategy
The testing approach emphasizes destructive testing scenarios that challenge Application Root's resilience including:
- View component initialization failures and timeout scenarios
- Malformed and invalid callback events from BoardSelectionView and BoardView
- Application lifecycle stress testing and forced shutdown scenarios
- Resource exhaustion during view transitions and memory pressure
- Concurrent navigation requests and state corruption scenarios
- Error propagation and recovery testing with component failures
