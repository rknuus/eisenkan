## [2025-09-06] - LoggingUtility Design Decision: Structured Data Serialization Strategy

**Decision**: Type Switch + Interface-based Approach (Option B)

**Context**: The SRS requires support for arbitrary Go types with preserved type information and human-readable narratives. Need to choose between reflection-based, type-switch-based, or hybrid approaches.

**Options Considered**: 
- Option A: Reflection-based JSON + Custom Formatting
- Option B: Type Switch + Interface-based Approach  
- Option C: Hybrid Approach

**Rationale**: Choose Option B to keep implementation simple as a starting point. Type switches provide better performance for common types, and interface-based approach allows extensibility. Fallback to fmt.Sprintf ensures all types are handled, even if not optimally.

**Consequences**: 
- Better performance for common logging scenarios
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- May require future enhancement for complex edge cases
- Interface adoption needed for optimal custom type logging

## [2025-09-06] - LoggingUtility Design Decision: Circular Reference Handling

**Decision**: Depth Limiting Only (Option B)

**Context**: STP requires handling of self-referencing structures without infinite loops. SRS specifies 5-level depth limit (REQ-FORMAT-003).

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Visited Map with Pointer Tracking
- Option B: Depth Limiting Only
- Option C: Visited Map + Depth Limiting

**Rationale**: Choose Option B to keep implementation simple and directly meet the "5 levels" requirement from SRS. Depth limiting prevents infinite loops effectively while maintaining simple implementation.

**Consequences**:
- Simple implementation without pointer tracking overhead
- Directly satisfies SRS depth requirement
- May not detect circular references at shallow depths (acceptable trade-off)
- Deterministic truncation behavior

## [2025-09-06] - LoggingUtility Design Decision: Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Panic on Internal Failures

**Context**: Need to determine how to handle internal logging failures (file system errors, configuration issues, etc.).

**Options Considered**:
- Option A: Silent Failure with Internal Error Tracking
- Option B: Best-Effort with Fallback
- Option C: Error Return with Graceful Degradation
- Option D: Panic on Internal Failures

**Rationale**: User decision to use fail-fast behavior. Panicking on internal failures provides clear failure indication and simpler implementation. Logging failures are typically configuration/environment issues that should be addressed immediately. This is in accordance to **REQ-RELIABILITY-001**: If log output fails, then the LoggingUtility shall crash the application.

**Consequences**:
- Simpler error handling implementation
- Clear failure signals for debugging
- Callers must handle potential panics or fix logging configuration
- Removes requirement for complex fallback logic

## [2025-09-06] - LoggingUtility Design Decision: Interface Design Revision

**Decision**: 3-Operation Interface with Extended Log Method

**Context**: Original SRS suggestion specified 4 operations including separate LogWithStructuredData. User wants to simplify to 3 operations.

**Original Proposed Interface**:
- LogWithStructuredData(level, context, data)
- Log(level, component, message) 
- LogError(level, component, error, context)
- IsLevelEnabled(level)

**Revised Interface Decision**:
- Log(level, component, message, data interface{}) - Extended with data parameter
- LogError(component, error, data interface{}) - Removed level parameter, always logs at Error level
- IsLevelEnabled(level) - Unchanged

**Rationale**: User wants to keep it simple with only 3 operations. Extending Log() with data parameter allows arbitrary data logging without separate method. This removes the need for StructuredLogContext structure.

**Consequences**:
- Simpler interface with fewer methods
- Single Log method handles both simple and structured logging
- No need for separate StructuredLogContext structure
- May need to handle nil data parameter gracefully
- **SRS Update Required**: Interface contract section needs revision
